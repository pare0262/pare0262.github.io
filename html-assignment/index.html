  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>My name is Esmeralda Paredes and it is a pleasure for me to introduce you myself the best I can. I may let you know that I am from the <abbr title="Dominican Republic">DR</abbr>, born on December 20<sup>th</sup>, 2001, now being 21 years old and the 1<sup>st</sup> girl of my parents and a Christian girl. </p>

  <p>Currently I am studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, and this is my first semester. Before I decided on taking this course I was working as a Digital Marketing in the <abbr title="Dominican Republic">DR</abbr>, before that I ended High School in 2018 and started studying photography at <abbr title="Instituto Tecnico Superior Comunitario">ITSC</abbr>, but I had to stop it because I had applied for this program at Algonquin College and if I had gotten accepted I would have to leave that program anyways. <em>It was a sacrifice but thanks God it worked out.</em> </p>
